# Extension Template Project

This project was created by PortSwigger to help you quickly start developing extensions in Java.

## Before you start

Before you begin development, make sure that your project's JDK is set to version "21".


## Writing your extension

To begin development, open the [Extension.java](src/main/java/Extension.java) file. It includes an example of setting your extension's name, which you can customize with your own logic.

The template contains the following components for building your extension:

* The `initialize` method. This is the entry point for your extension. It is called when the extension is loaded and receives a [montoyaApi](https://portswigger.github.io/burp-extensions-montoya-api/javadoc/burp/api/montoya/MontoyaApi.html) argument, which provides access to all Montoya API features.
* The `Extension` class. This implements the BurpExtension interface, so your extension is recognized and loaded by Burp.

For more information on Montoya API features, see the [JavaDoc](https://portswigger.github.io/burp-extensions-montoya-api/javadoc/burp/api/montoya/MontoyaApi.html).

To explore example extensions, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PortSwigger/burp-extensions-montoya-api-examples).

## Building your extension

When you're ready to test and use your extension, follow these steps to build a JAR file and load it into Burp.

### Building the JAR file (Gradle)

To build the JAR file, run the following command in the root directory of this project:

* For UNIX-based systems: `./gradlew jar`
* For Windows systems: `gradlew jar`

If successful, the JAR file is saved to `<project_root_directory>/build/libs/<project_name>.jar`. If the build fails, errors are shown in the console. By default, the project name is `extension-template-project`. You can change this in the [settings.gradle.kts](./settings.gradle.kts) file.

### Building the JAR file (Maven)

This repository also includes a ready-to-use Maven configuration to build a Burp-loadable JAR named `paramamador.jar`.

1) Ensure you have JDK 21 on PATH (`java -version`).
2) Make the Montoya API available to Maven:
   - Recommended: keep the provided dependency `net.portswigger.burp.extensions:montoya-api:${montoya.version}`. Maven Central hosts recent versions.
   - Offline/local JAR: install your Montoya JAR once: `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/montoya-api.jar -DgroupId=net.portswigger.burp.extensions -DartifactId=montoya-api -Dversion=2025.8 -Dpackaging=jar`
3) Build: `mvn -q -DskipTests package`

The output JAR is written to `target/paramamador.jar`. Gson is shaded inside; Montoya is marked `provided` and is supplied by Burp at runtime.


## Loading the JAR file into Burp

To load the JAR file into Burp:

1. In Burp, go to **Extensions > Installed**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Under **Extension details**, click **Select file**.
4. Select the JAR file you just built, then click **Open**.
5. [Optional] Under **Standard output** and **Standard error**, choose where to save output and error messages.
6. Click **Next**. The extension is loaded into Burp.
7. Review any messages displayed in the **Output** and **Errors** tabs.
8. Click **Close**.

Your extension is loaded and listed in the **Burp extensions** table. You can test its behavior and make changes to the code as necessary.

### Reloading the JAR file in Burp

If you make changes to the code, you must rebuild the JAR file and reload your extension in Burp for the changes to take effect.

To rebuild the JAR file, follow the steps for [building the JAR file](#building-the-jar-file).

To quickly reload your extension in Burp:

1. In Burp, go to **Extensions > Installed**.
2. Hold `Ctrl` or `âŒ˜`, and select the **Loaded** checkbox next to your extension.

## Paramamador overview (Maven project)

Paramamador is a Burp Suite Pro extension built on the Montoya API. It passively aggregates parameter names and discovers endpoints from JavaScript.

- Passive collection in the background (no blocking in proxy):
  - Parameters from URL query, form bodies (urlencoded/multipart), cookies, and JSON keys in request/response bodies (via Gson).
  - Endpoints/links from JavaScript using regex patterns (full URLs, absolute/relative paths, template literals and simple string concatenations). Variables and expressions are masked with `EXPR`.
- UI: Suite tab with three sub-tabs
  - Parameters: browse, filter, copy and export.
  - Endpoints: browse, filter, view context snippet, ignore.
  - Settings: scope-only toggle, autosave interval, inline/queue size limits, ignored patterns list, export folder, clear data, rescan Site Tree.
- Site Tree rescan: scans Target Site Map for `.js` URLs not yet analyzed and fetches them through Burp's HTTP client for analysis.
- Persistence: saves `paramamador_endpoints.json` and `paramamador_parameters.json` to the configured export directory every N seconds (default 300s) and on demand.

Build with Maven: `mvn -q -DskipTests package` then load `target/paramamador.jar` in Burp.

Notes
- Heavy work is offloaded to background worker threads. Large JavaScript (>= 200 KB by default) is queued.
- External/CDN JavaScript is processed if the Referer is in scope; you can add ignore patterns in Settings.
- Do not log sensitive values: the extension avoids logging parameter content to Burp output.



## Sharing your extension

Once you've built your extension, we'd love to see what you've created!

Share your extension on our [PortSwigger Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1159124119074381945/1164175825474686996) #extensions channel to get feedback, showcase your work, and connect with other developers.
Then take it to the next level by submitting your extension to the BApp store, making it available to the community of 80,000+ users worldwide.

For guidance on the submission process, see [Submitting extensions to the BApp store](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/extensions/creating/bapp-store-submitting-extensions).
